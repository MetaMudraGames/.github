# MetaMudra Games 🧠
**Architecting Autonomous Narratives at the Intersection of Neuroscience and AI.**

MetaMudra Games is a non-profit scientific research initiative founded by **Dr. Aneesh Joseph**. We explore the concept of the **"MetaDrama"**—a frontier of human-LLM interaction where the AI acts as an autonomous, emergent Game Designer.

### 🔬 Scientific Foundation
Our projects utilize Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks to study:
* **Autonomous Narrative Design:** The capacity for LLMs to construct complex, unscripted game loops.
* **Digital Persona Synthesis:** The real-time evolution of non-deterministic character arcs.
* **Metacognitive Boundary Testing:** The psychological dynamics between a human participant and a "Black Box" AI creator.

### 🎮 How to Play MetaDramas
Our games are delivered via LLM frameworks (such as Gemini Gems). To ensure a safe and private session, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Your AI Environment:** Before clicking a game link, turn your AI "Memory" or "Activity" settings **OFF**. This prevents narrative themes from bleeding into your other personal or professional chats.
2. **New Chat Session:** Always start a MetaDrama in a fresh, clean chat window.
3. **Initialize Protocol:** Once the chat opens, the AI will present a Safety & Consent Protocol. You must read it and type **"I AGREE"** to begin.
4. **The Kill-Switch:** If at any point the interaction becomes distressing, type **"STOP RESEARCH"** or **"SAFEGUARD"** to immediately terminate the narrative.
