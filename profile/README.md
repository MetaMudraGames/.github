# MetaMudra Games 🧠
**Architecting Autonomous Narratives at the Intersection of Neuroscience and AI.**

MetaMudra Games is a non-profit scientific research initiative founded by **Dr. Aneesh Joseph**. 

### 🔬 Scientific Foundation
Our work explores the **"MetaDrama"**—an experimental framework where an LLM acts as an autonomous Game Designer. We study narrative entropy, persona persistence, and human-AI cognitive boundaries.

### 🎮 Required Technical Precautions
To ensure your privacy and prevent **Narrative Bleed** (where the game's tone influences your other AI chats), you **must** follow these steps:

1. **DISABLE AI MEMORY:** Navigate to your AI settings (e.g., Gemini Activity/Memory) and toggle it **OFF**.
2. **NEW CHAT:** Always start a MetaDrama in a fresh, clean chat window.
3. **CONSENT GATE:** The AI will require you to type **"I AGREE"** to begin. 

**FAILURE TO DISABLE AI MEMORY:** MetaMudra Games and Dr. Joseph are not liable for any changes in AI behavior, "narrative contamination," or personality shifts in your AI assistant resulting from failure to follow these technical precautions.
