  MetaMudra Games is a research-oriented framework for LLM-driven 'MetaDramas'. 
  It explores the intersection of human physiology, cognitive neuroscience, 
  and autonomous AI narrative design. The project studies emergent narrative 
  complexity and the metacognitive boundaries of human-AI interaction 
  using non-deterministic prompt-engineering architectures.
