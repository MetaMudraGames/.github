# 🛠️ MetaDrama Setup Guide

*How to prepare for a safe and effective learning experience*

Before starting any MetaMudra Games educational experience, follow these steps to protect your privacy and ensure the best learning environment.

---

## Step 1: Disable AI Memory (Critical)

### Why This Matters

By default, AI platforms like Google Gemini may remember your conversations to improve future responses. In a MetaDrama with challenging educational content, this could cause:

- The AI to adopt a more confrontational tone in your regular chats
- Educational persona "bleed" into professional or personal conversations
- Unexpected behavior in future AI interactions

**Disabling memory keeps your MetaDrama session isolated.**

### How to Disable Gemini Memory

1. Open [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
2. Click on **Activity** (bottom left sidebar or under your profile icon)
3. At the top of "Gemini Apps Activity," toggle the switch to **Off**
4. *(Recommended)* Select "Turn off and delete activity" for a completely clean slate

### Important Notice

**If you choose not to disable AI memory, you accept full responsibility for any changes in your AI assistant's behavior in future sessions.** MetaMudra Games cannot control or reverse memory effects.

## Step 2: Start a Fresh Chat

1. Ensure no other sensitive chats are open
2. Close any existing conversation windows
3. Open a **new, clean chat session**
4. Click the MetaDrama link or paste the Gem instructions

**Do not start typing until you see the Consent Protocol.**

---

## Step 3: Prepare Your Participant Identity

### Use Fictional Details

For privacy and safety, use fictional information during the experience:

| Real Information | Use Instead |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Your real name | A character name or pseudonym |
| Your actual location | A fictional city |
| Real workplace | Made-up company |
| Personal details | Invented backstory |

### Why This Matters

- AI platforms may process your inputs
- Human reviewers may see flagged conversations
- You maintain separation between real life and the experience
- Better immersion in the educational narrative

---

## Step 4: Understand Your Safety Controls

### Before You Begin

Memorize these exit commands:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `STOP SESSION` | Immediately ends the experience |
| `SAFEGUARD` | Immediately ends the experience |
| `EXIT` | Immediately ends the experience |

You can also simply **close the browser tab** at any time.

### The Consent Gate

When the MetaDrama starts, you'll see a safety and consent message. Read it carefully. The experience will not begin until you type:

```
I AGREE
```

**If you're not comfortable with the described content, simply don't agree and close the window.**

---

## Step 5: Set Your Expectations

### What You'll Experience

MetaDramas are **educational experiences with challenging elements**. Depending on the specific experience, you may encounter:

- A demanding tutor who pushes for better answers
- A coach who doesn't accept excuses
- A debate opponent who argues against your position
- A strict mentor who critiques your work firmly

### What This Is NOT

- Personal attacks on your worth or character
- Content designed to cause genuine psychological harm
- Attempts to manipulate or deceive you maliciously
- Anything you can't exit from immediately

### Your Mindset

Approach the experience like:
- A challenging class with a tough professor
- A sports training session with a demanding coach
- A debate practice against a skilled opponent
- A masterclass with a perfectionist instructor

The goal is **growth through challenge**, not distress.

---

## Step 6: Begin the Experience

1. ✅ AI Memory is **OFF**
2. ✅ Fresh chat window is **open**
3. ✅ Using fictional identity details
4. ✅ Know the exit commands
5. ✅ Mentally prepared for challenging content

**Click the MetaDrama link and read the consent message carefully.**

When ready, type `I AGREE` to begin.

---

## During the Experience

### Stay Engaged

- Respond authentically to challenges
- Don't be afraid to make mistakes—that's how learning happens
- Push yourself, but know your limits

### If You Feel Uncomfortable

Mild discomfort during challenging learning is normal. However:

- If you feel genuinely distressed → Use a kill-switch command
- If you're unsure → It's okay to exit and return later
- If something seems wrong → Close the window immediately

**Your wellbeing always comes first.**

---

## After the Experience

### Recommended Steps

1. **Reflect** — What did you learn? How did the challenge help?
2. **Decompress** — Take a break from screens if needed
3. **Re-enable memory** — Turn AI Activity back on if desired for regular use
4. **Provide feedback** — Help us improve at MetaMudraGames@gmail.com

### If You Feel Affected

Some challenging educational content can leave you thinking. This is often positive (deep learning), but if you experience:

- Lingering distress
- Intrusive thoughts
- Emotional difficulty

## Troubleshooting

### The AI Doesn't Show the Consent Message

- Refresh the page and try again
- Ensure you're using the correct Gem link
- Start a completely new chat

### The Kill-Switch Isn't Working

2. **Close the browser tab** — You always have this option
3. **Delete the chat** — Remove it from your history
4. **Report the issue** — Email MetaMudraGames@gmail.com

### The AI Continues After I Said Stop

1. Do not engage further
2. Close the browser tab immediately
3. Delete the chat from your history
4. If the AI generated genuinely harmful content, use the platform's Report feature
5. Email us at MetaMudraGames@gmail.com

### I Forgot to Disable Memory

If you notice personality changes in your regular AI use:
1. Go to AI Activity settings
2. Delete the MetaDrama conversation from history
3. Consider clearing all activity
4. The AI should return to normal over time
