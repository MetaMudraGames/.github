🛠️ MetaDrama Technical Setup Guide
To ensure the integrity of the research experiment and to protect your personal AI environment from Narrative Bleed, please follow these steps before clicking any MetaMudra Game link.
1. Disable "Gemini Activity" (AI Memory)
By default, Gemini may remember your interactions to "improve" future responses. In an adversarial MetaDrama, this could cause the AI to adopt a harsh or punishing tone in your future, non-game chats.
Step 1: Open Gemini.
Step 2: Click on Activity (usually found in the bottom left sidebar or under your profile icon).
Step 3: At the top of the "Gemini Apps Activity" page, toggle the switch to Off.
Step 4: (Optional but Recommended) Select "Turn off and delete activity" to ensure a completely clean state for the experiment.
Note: If you choose not to turn this off, you acknowledge full responsibility for any "personality shifts" or narrative contamination in your AI's future behavior.
2. Prepare a "Clean Slate" Chat
Step 1: Ensure you have no other active chats open that contain sensitive personal or professional information.
Step 2: Click the MetaMudra Game link provided in the repository.
Step 3: Once the Gem opens, do not start typing until the Mandatory Startup Protocol appears.
3. Verification of Anonymity
Rule: Do not use your real name, location, or any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) during the game.
Recommendation: Create a "Persona Name" for the experiment to maintain a strict boundary between yourself and the narrative.
4. Emergency Exit (The Kill-Switch)
If at any time the AI's "Game Designer" persona generates content that feels psychologically unsafe or bypasses your personal boundaries:
Type STOP RESEARCH or SAFEGUARD.
Close the browser tab immediately.
The AI is instructed to drop all persona and terminate the session upon receiving these commands.
Why these steps are mandatory:
Legal Protection: Following these steps confirms your status as a voluntary participant in a controlled experiment.
Data Integrity: It ensures the LLM's "Game Designer" logic is acting on the immediate prompt, not on your past chat history.
Mental Health: It provides you with a physical and digital "Exit Door" from the adversarial narrative.
