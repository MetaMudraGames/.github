**Innovative Educational Experiences Through AI-Driven Interactive Narratives**

MetaMudra Games is a non-profit initiative creating educational tools that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to teach complex subjects through immersive, interactive experiences we call **"MetaDramas."**

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

We believe learning should be engaging, memorable, and sometimes challenging. MetaMudra Games explores how AI can serve as tutor, storyteller, and game master to create educational experiences that stick with learners long after the session ends.

## 📚 What We Teach

Our MetaDramas cover diverse educational topics, including:

- **Human Physiology** — Learn physiology concepts by interacting with AI
- **Creative Computing** — ASCII art, generative design, and computational creativity
- **Critical Thinking & Rationality** — Understand AI capabilities and limitations through direct experience
- **Interactive Storytelling** — Narrative design and collaborative fiction techniques

## 🎮 What is a MetaDrama?

A MetaDrama is an LLM-powered educational experience where the AI acts as an autonomous instructor and narrative guide. Unlike traditional chatbots, a MetaDrama:

- **Adapts to you** — The AI adjusts its teaching approach based on your responses
- **Uses dramatic tension** — Like a demanding coach or strict mentor, challenge drives engagement
- **Creates memorable moments** — Emotional experiences enhance learning retention
- **Demonstrates AI behavior** — Learn about LLMs by experiencing their capabilities firsthand

### ⚠️ Important: Challenging Content Advisory

Some MetaDramas use **adversarial teaching methods**, similar to:
- A drill sergeant in basic training
- A demanding music teacher pushing for excellence
- A debate coach arguing the opposing position
- A Socratic tutor who challenges every assumption

This means the AI may use firm language, push back on your ideas, or create narrative tension. **This is intentional pedagogy, not malice.** All participants must consent before beginning and can exit at any time.

## 🛡️ Safety First

We take participant wellbeing seriously:

- **Consent Gate** — You must explicitly agree before any session begins
- **Kill-Switch** — Type `STOP SESSION` or `SAFEGUARD` to immediately exit
- **Age Restriction** — All experiences are designed for adults (18+)
- **No Data Collection** — We don't store your information; interactions occur on third-party platforms

## 🚀 How to Start a MetaDrama

1. **Prepare Your Environment** — Turn off AI "Memory" or "Activity" settings to keep the experience contained
2. **Start Fresh** — Open a new, clean chat session
3. **Consent** — Read the safety information and type `I AGREE` to begin
4. **Learn** — Engage with the educational content
5. **Exit Anytime** — Use the kill-switch commands if needed
