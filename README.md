# MetaMudra Games 🧠🌌
**Architecting Autonomous Narratives at the Intersection of Neuroscience and AI.**

MetaMudra Games is a non-profit research-oriented game studio founded by **Dr. Aneesh Joseph**. Our mission is to explore the "MetaDrama"—a frontier of human-LLM interaction where the AI is not just a character, but the emergent Game Designer.

### 🔬 Scientific Foundation
Our projects leverage foundations in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Human Physiology** to study:
* **Digital Persona Synthesis:** How LLMs evolve character arcs in real-time.
* **Autonomous Narrative Design:** The capacity for LLMs to construct and manage complex game loops.
* **Metacognitive Interaction:** The psychological boundary between the player and the "Black Box" designer.

### ⚠️ A Note on Methodology
These games are **non-deterministic experiments**. We provide the framework; the LLM provides the soul. As such, the outputs are autonomous and unscripted.
