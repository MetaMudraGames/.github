# Safety, Ethics, and Psychological Disclosure

### 1. Nature of the Research
MetaMudra Games produces "MetaDramas." These experiences utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate autonomous content. By engaging with this software/links, you acknowledge that the developer does not pre-write or moderate individual AI outputs in real-time.

### 2. Hallucination Warning
LLMs are prone to "hallucination"—generating factually incorrect, nonsensical, or disturbing content. MetaMudra Games is not responsible for the nature of the AI’s generated dialogue, narrative turns, or behavior.

### 3. Psychological Safety
* **Psychosis & Self-Harm:** If you have a history of psychosis, severe anxiety, or are experiencing thoughts of self-harm, be advised that the unpredictable nature of autonomous AI may act as a trigger.
* **Intense Narratives:** Our games explore complex psychological themes. These are experimental and intended for participants with high emotional resilience.
* **Not Medical Advice:** While the developer is a medical professional, the content generated by the AI is **not** clinical, medical, or psychological advice.

### 4. Age Restriction
All MetaMudra Games are intended for audiences **aged 18 and older**. By proceeding, you confirm you are of legal age and consent to interacting with unscripted AI.
