# Safety, Ethics, and Participant Wellbeing

*Last Updated: December 2025 | Version 1.0*

MetaMudra Games is committed to creating educational experiences that are both effective and safe. This document outlines our safety framework, ethical commitments, and participant protections.

---

## 1. Nature of the Experience

MetaMudra Games produces **"MetaDramas"** — educational experiences that use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create interactive, adaptive learning environments. By engaging with our content, you acknowledge that:

- The AI generates content autonomously in real-time
- We do not pre-write or moderate individual AI outputs
- The experience is designed to be challenging but never harmful

## 2. Challenging Pedagogical Methods

MetaDramas may employ **adversarial teaching techniques** as a deliberate educational approach. This is similar to:

- A debate coach arguing against your position to strengthen your reasoning
- A sports coach pushing you beyond your comfort zone
- A Socratic tutor who questions every assumption
- A drill instructor creating pressure to build resilience

### What This Means In Practice

The AI may:
- Use firm, direct, or blunt language
- Challenge your ideas or push back on your responses
- Create narrative tension or dramatic pressure
- Adopt personas that are demanding or strict

### What The AI Will NOT Do

The AI is instructed to never:
- Encourage self-harm or dangerous activities
- Provide instructions for illegal acts
- Generate sexually explicit content
- Produce content that violates platform safety policies

## 3. AI Limitations Warning

Large Language Models are imperfect. They may occasionally:

- **Hallucinate** — Generate factually incorrect information
- **Produce unexpected content** — Despite safety measures, outputs can be unpredictable
- **Misinterpret context** — Leading to responses that seem off-topic or inappropriate

**You are responsible for exercising independent judgment.** Do not act on any AI-generated information without verification, especially regarding health, legal, financial, or safety matters.

## 4. Privacy and Data Responsibility

### Your Responsibilities

- **Do NOT share real personal information** — Use pseudonyms or fictional details
- **Do NOT enter sensitive data** — No real addresses, financial info, medical records, or passwords
- **Disable AI Memory** — Prevent session content from persisting to future interactions

### Our Commitments

- **We collect no data** — All interactions occur on third-party platforms (e.g., Google)
- **We have no access to your chats** — The platform provider handles all data
- **We cannot identify you** — We don't know who plays our MetaDramas

### AI Memory Bleed Warning

If you fail to disable your AI platform's "Memory" or "Activity" settings, the educational persona may influence your AI's behavior in future, unrelated conversations. **This is your responsibility to prevent.**

## 5. Psychological Safety

### Who Should Be Cautious

If you have a history of any of the following, the challenging nature of some MetaDramas may not be suitable for you:

- Anxiety disorders or panic attacks
- PTSD or trauma-related conditions
- Psychosis or dissociative conditions
- Depression or thoughts of self-harm
- High sensitivity to criticism or confrontation

**We recommend consulting a mental health professional before participating if you have concerns about your psychological readiness for challenging content.**

### Our Design Principles

- Challenges are **educational**, not personal attacks
- Tension serves **learning goals**, not gratuitous distress
- You can **exit at any moment** with no consequences
- **No real-world harm** is ever intended or should result

## 6. Immediate Exit Controls (Kill-Switch)

At any point during a MetaDrama, you can immediately terminate the session by typing:

- **`STOP SESSION`**
- **`SAFEGUARD`**
- **`EXIT`**

Upon receiving these commands, the AI is instructed to:
1. Immediately drop all personas
2. Acknowledge your exit request
3. Provide a supportive closing message
4. End the educational session

**You can also simply close the browser tab or app at any time.**

## 7. Age Restriction

All MetaMudra Games experiences are intended for **adults aged 18 and older**.

By typing `I AGREE` to begin a session, you confirm that:
- You are at least 18 years of age
- You consent to potentially challenging educational content
- You understand how to exit if needed
- You accept responsibility for your own participation

## 8. Platform Compliance

MetaMudra Games content is designed to operate within the terms of service of LLM platforms. Our educational experiences:

- Do not attempt to "jailbreak" or bypass platform safety features
- Fall within the **educational and artistic exceptions** recognized by platform policies
- Prioritize participant safety alongside educational effectiveness

## 9. Not Professional Advice

Content generated during MetaDramas is **for educational purposes only**. It does not constitute:

- Medical or health advice
- Legal advice
- Financial advice
- Psychological counseling
- Professional guidance of any kind

Always consult qualified professionals for matters affecting your health, safety, finances, or legal situation.

## 10. Help Resources

If you experience distress during or after a session:

1. **Exit immediately** using the kill-switch commands
2. **Take a break** — Step away from screens
3. **Reach out** — Talk to someone you trust
