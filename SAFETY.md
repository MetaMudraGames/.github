# Safety, Ethics, and Psychological Disclosure

### 1. Nature of the Software
MetaMudra Games produces "MetaDramas." These experiences utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate autonomous content. By engaging with this software, you acknowledge that the developer (**Dr. Aneesh Joseph / MetaMudra Games**) does not pre-write or moderate individual AI outputs in real-time.

### 2. Hallucination Warning
LLMs are known to "hallucinate"—generating factually incorrect, nonsensical, or disturbing content. MetaMudra Games is not responsible for the accuracy or the nature of the AI’s generated dialogue, graphics, or narrative decisions.

### 3. Psychological Safety & Risk
* **Intense Narratives:** Our games explore complex psychological themes. These may include high-stress situations, conflict, or existential dread.
* **Psychosis & Self-Harm:** If you have a history of psychosis, severe anxiety, or are currently experiencing thoughts of self-harm, please be advised that the unpredictable nature of autonomous AI agents may be a trigger. 
* **Not Medical Advice:** While the developer is a medical professional (Physiology), the content generated by these games is **not** clinical, medical, or psychological advice.

### 4. Age Restriction
All MetaMudra Games are intended for audiences **aged 18 and older**. By using this software, you confirm you are of legal age and possess the emotional resilience to interact with unscripted AI.
